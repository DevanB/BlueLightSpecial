= BlueLightSpecial

BlueLightSpecial is a derivative from Thoughtbot's 
{Clearance}[http://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance] gem.  It authenticates 
a visitor by email and password, but additionally integrates MadMimi for 
outgoing notification emails.  Also, a role system and administrative user
impersonation are baked in.
